# Peanut Butter Jelly Time!

# First Goal: Create a program that can tell you whether or not you can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

# Second Goal: Modify that program to tell you: if you can make a sandwich, how many you can make

# Third Goal: Modify that program to allow you to make open-face sandwiches if you have an odd number of slices of bread ( )

# Fourth Goal: Modify that program to tell you: if you're missing ingredients, which ones you need to be able to make your sandwiches

# Fifth Goal: Modify that program to tell you: if you have enough bread and peanut butter but no jelly, that you can make a peanut butter sandwich but you should take a hard, honest look at your life.  Wow, your program is kinda judgy.

# To satisfy the first goal:
#		If you have enough bread (2 slices), peanut butter (1), and jelly (1), print a message like
#"I can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich"; 
#		If you don't; print a message like "Looks like I don't have a lunch today"

# To satisfy the second goal:
#		Continue from the first goal, and add:
#		If you have enough bread (at least 2 slices), peanut butter (at least 1), and jelly (at least 1),
#print a message like "I can make this many sandwiches: " and then calculate the result.
#		If you don't; you can print the same message as before

# To satisfy the third goal:
#		Continue from the second goal, and add:
#		If you have an odd number of slices of bread* and odd amount of peanut butter and jelly, print a message like before, but mention that you can make an open-face sandwich, too.
#		If you don't have enough ingredients; still print the same message as before
#		* To calculate whether you have an odd number, see https://github.com/shannonturner/python-lessons/blob/master/section_01_(basics)/simple_math.py

# To satisfy the fourth goal:
#		Continue from the third goal, but this time if you have enough bread and peanut butter but no jelly, print a message that tells you that you can make a peanut butter sandwich
#		Or if you have more peanut butter and bread than jelly, that you can make a certain number of peanut butter & jelly sandwiches and a certain number of peanut butter sandwiches



# To satisfy the fifth goal:
#		Continue from the fourth goal, but this time if you don't have enough ingredients, print a message that tells you which ones you're missing.
