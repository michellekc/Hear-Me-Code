# Difficulty level: Beginner

# Goal #1: Write a new version of the PB&J program that uses a while loop.  Print "Making sandwich #" and the number of the sandwich until you are out of bread, peanut butter, or jelly.

# Example:
# bread = 4
# peanut_butter = 3
# jelly = 10

# Output:
# Making sandwich #1
# Making sandwich #2
# All done; only had enough bread for 2 sandwiches.

# Goal #2: Modify that program to say how many sandwiches-worth of each ingredient remains.

# Example 2:
# bread = 10
# peanut_butter = 10
# jelly = 4

# Output:
# Making sandwich #1
# I have enough bread for 4 more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for 9 more, and enough jelly for 3 more.
# Making sandwich #2
# I have enough bread for 3 more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for 8 more, and enough jelly for 2 more.
# Making sandwich #3
# I have enough bread for 2 more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for 7 more, and enough jelly for 1 more.
# Making sandwich #4
# All done; I ran out of jelly.

bread = 8
peanut_butter = 4
jelly = 7
sandwich_count = 1

while bread >= 2 and peanut_butter >= 1 and jelly >= 1:
    print "Making sandwich #{0}".format(sandwich_count)
    print "I have enough bread for {0} more sandwiches, enough peanut butter for {1} more, and enough jelly for {2} more.".format(bread/2, peanut_butter, jelly)
    bread = bread - 2
    peanut_butter = peanut_butter - 1
    jelly = jelly - 1
    sandwich_count = sandwich_count + 1
if bread == 0:
    print "All done; I'm out of bread"
elif peanut_butter == 0:
    print "All done; I'm out of peanut butter"
elif jelly == 0:
        print "All done; I'm out of jelly."
